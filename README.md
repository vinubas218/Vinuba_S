This repository contains 3 Java and 1 Python files.

Problem_1
Created a program that performs Addition, Subtraction, Muliplication, Division using class. Here, I used Java to perform the task.

Problem_2
Generated a series of numbers using a single integer input. Done using Java.

Problem_3
This is literally same as the problem solved before but the difference is for even inputs too, it should print the same as printed for odd numbers. I preferred Java to solve this.

Problem_4
This is a dictionary problem so I decided to use Python to solve this. This is to count the number of multiples from an given array in a given range 1 to 9.
